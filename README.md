Text Summarizer using NLP (Extractive Method) This project is a simple Text Summarization tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to summarize long text into short, meaningful summaries. Tech Stack

Python
NLP
NLTK
Sumy (LexRank summarizer)
Google Colab How It Works
User inputs a long paragraph or article.
The summarizer uses LexRank, an extractive NLP algorithm, to select key sentences.
Output is a shortened version of the input text. Example
Input:

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence...

Output:

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence... Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance... Run the Project

Open the notebook text_summarizer.ipynb in Google Colab.
Install dependencies and run the cells.
Paste your own text when prompted to generate a summary. Output Preview Paste your text below to summarize: Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. It has many practical applications, including voice recognition, spam filtering, image recognition, and predictive analytics. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of these systems, making them more reliable and useful in real-world situations.
